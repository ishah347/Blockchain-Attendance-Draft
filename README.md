# Blockchain-Attendance-Draft

Draft for an app that would allow instructor to take attendance by having students enter a daily code.
The app would append the day's records as a block to a blockchain to ensure immutability. 
The instructor would be able to see these records at any time.
Currently runs using Flask; will use draft to create iOS app by February 2019.
